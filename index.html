    <h3>Readability</h3>

    <p>Always write code with the knowledge that others will be reading it now and in the future:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Name things accurately and sensibly. <code>errorType</code> makes a hell of a lot more sense than <code>et</code>.</li>
      <li>Don’t be stingy with whitespace. Whitespace is an important factor in readable code. Separate declarations, blocks and conceptually similar chunks of functionality with newlines.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Simplicity</h3>

    <p>When you write code with a team, <strong>simple beats clever, every time</strong>. If your clever trick requires an explanatory comment that is longer than the code itself, consider simplifying it so it’s easier to read, understand, and maintain.</p>
